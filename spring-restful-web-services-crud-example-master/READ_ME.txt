DESCRIPTION:

This project represents a base Spring 4 legacy project for Spring MVC / REST services.  The REST services are
handled / tested by index.html.  This is done so you can see an example of how to call all of the CRUD 
functions from a web page.  Most projects do not make the calls from a web page but from POSTMAN or even from a 
test function which does you no good if you are trying to figure out how to do call from a webpage.
